# README: How to Run the Frontend

## Steps to Set Up and Run the Frontend Project

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed (version 16 or higher recommended)
- npm installed (comes with Node.js)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### 2. Switch to the `laya_mvc` Branch
To ensure you're working on the latest codebase, switch to the `laya_mvc` branch:
```bash
git checkout laya_mvc
git pull origin laya_mvc
```

### 3. Create Your Own Branch
To avoid making changes to the `laya_mvc` branch, create and switch to your own branch:
```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```
Replace `<your-branch-name>` with your desired branch name (e.g., `feature-xyz`).

### 4. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the frontend directory (if not already in the root of the project) and install the required npm packages:
```bash
npm install
npm install axios
```

### 5. Start the Development Server
Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the frontend on a development server (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). If you're using a different port, the server will indicate the URL.

### 6. Make Changes in Your Branch
You can now make any changes to the code in your own branch. Ensure you do **not** make any changes directly to the `laya_mvc` branch.

### 7. Save Your Changes and Commit
After making your changes, add and commit your work:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
```

### 8. Push Your Changes to Your Branch
Push your branch to the repository:
```bash
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```

### 9. Testing Your Code
Ensure your changes work correctly by thoroughly testing your branch. If required, ask for a code review before merging to other branches.

### 10. Do **Not** Push Directly to `laya_mvc`
Remember, **do not push directly to the `laya_mvc` branch**. Always create and work in your own branch.

### Helpful Git Commands
- **Switch to a branch**:
  ```bash
  git checkout <branch-name>
  ```
- **Pull the latest changes in your branch**:
  ```bash
  git pull origin <your-branch-name>
  ```
- **Fetch and list all branches**:
  ```bash
  git fetch --all
  git branch -a
  ```

If you encounter issues or need help, reach out to the repository owner for clarification. Follow the branching policy strictly to maintain code integrity in the `laya_mvc` branch.
